Curiosity for the better world
======
I am currently a first-year M.S.(Informatics) student at Pennsylvania State University, sepcializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with keen focus on Extended Reality (XR) and  AI-assisted technology applications. Under the guidance of Prof. Ting-hao (Kenneth) Huang at CrowdAI Lab. 

Prior to my current M.S. studies, I pursued my M.Des.(Interaction Design) at National Taipei University of Technology, where I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Ping-Hsuan Han at XRLab. 

My research pursuits stem from a profound interest in understanding human behavior and a fervent aspiration to develop technologies that enhance various aspects of human life.
