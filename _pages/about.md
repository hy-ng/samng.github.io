I am currently a second-year M.S.(Informatics) student at Pennsylvania State University, sepcializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with keen focus on Extended Reality (XR) and  AI-assisted technology applications. Under the guidance of [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/) at CrowdAI Lab. 

Prior to my current M.S. studies, I pursued my M.Des.(Interaction Design) at National Taipei University of Technology, where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Ping-Hsuan Han](https://pinghsuan.info/) at XRLab. 

My research pursuits stem from a profound interest in understanding human behavior and a fervent aspiration to develop technologies that enhance various aspects of human life.

I am eagerly seeking research opportunities, including internships and PhD programs. If you find my profile compelling, please don't hesitate to reach out via email. I would love to explore potential collaborations together.
