About Me
I am a second-year M.S. student in Informatics at [Pennsylvania State University, College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/) . My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a particular focus on Extended Reality (XR), Haptics, and Human-Centered AI. I am currently working under the guidance of Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang, a renowned researcher in the field, at the CrowdAI Lab.


My Academic Journey
- Currenlty I am in the final semester of dual-degree program (Expected: Dec 2024), pursuing an M.S. in Informatics at Penn State and an M.Des. in Interaction Design at [National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech), Department of Interaction Design](https://ixd.ntut.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en).
- Adivsors: I have had the privilege of working with expectional advisors:
  - Current Advisor: [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/) at Crowd-AI Lab in Penn State. 
  - Previous Advisor: [Prof. Ping-Hsuan Han](https://pinghsuan.info/) at [XR Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@xrlabntut0411) in Taipei Tech.

My Vision
I envision a future where AI serves as a collaborative tool, enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. Leveraging my background as a UX Designer and my current role as an HCI researcher, I am deeply interested in developing applications that harness AI to boost creativity and streamline the research process.  This approach aims to elevate the quality of knowledge work and accelerate the advancement of human civilization.

Oportunities

I am actively seeking research opportunities, including internships and PhD programs. You can check [my CV here](./publicFiles/CV.pdf). If you find my profile compelling, please feel free to reach out via email. I am eager to explore potential collaborations and contribute to innovative projects.

<!-- I am a second-year M.S. student Informatics at [Pennsylvania State University, College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/). My core research focus is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I aim to develop technologies that serve human needs and enhance human capabilities. My interests span several interconnected areas, including Extended Reality (XR) and Haptics, Human-Centered AI, and the exploration of technology's potential in various setting such as Entertainment, Health, Knowledge Work. My research goal is to create technology that serve humans, fostering a collaborative relationship where technology enhances huamn well-being.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to meet and work with exceptional advisors who have guided me through this challenging yet rewarding path:
- Currently I am under the guidance of [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu/) at Crowd-AI Lab in Penn State. 
- Prior to my current M.S. studies, I completed my M.Des. in Interaction Design at [National Taipei University of Technology, Department of Interaction Design](https://ixd.ntut.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Ping-Hsuan Han](https://pinghsuan.info/) at XRLab. 

I envision the future where AI could be a good 'collaborator' and 'tool' for human user, but not replacing human. 
With my prior experience as UX Designer and current HCI researcher, I am particularly interested into developing application utlizing AI to facilitate creativivty and research process (which to help us to produce high quality of knowledge work and speed up the force to push further human civilization)

I am actively seeking research opportunities, including internships and PhD programs. If you find my profile compelling, please don't hesitate to reach out via email. I would love to explore potential collaborations together. -->
