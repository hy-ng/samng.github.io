**<u>About Me</u>**

Hi! I am a recent M.S. gradate in Informatics from [Pennsylvania State University's College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working with [Dr. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](http://kennethhuang.cc/){:target="_blank"} at Crowd-AI Lab in Penn State with projects focus on AI caption writing tool for scientific figures in academic publications.

 My research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and emerging technologies, with particular emphasis on **Technical HCI**. My work spans several key areas, including **Extended Reality (XR)**, **Haptics**, **Human-Centered AI**, **Visualization**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

 Leveraging my multi-disciplinary background, I love to build tech that makes life better and easier for people, while exploring new ideas to push the boundaries of what's possible.


**<u>My Academic Journey</u>**

 - I completed my M.S. in Informatics in the Pennsylvania State University's College of IST, under the guidance of [Dr. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](http://kennethhuang.cc/) in December, 2024.
 - I completed my M.Des. in Interaction Design at [National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech)'s Department of Interaction Design](https://ixd.ntut.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en){:target="_blank"}, under the guidance of [Dr. Ping-Hsuan Han](https://pinghsuan.info/){:target="_blank"} at [XR Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@xrlabntut0411){:target="_blank"} in July, 2023.


**<u>My Vision</u>**

> I envision a future where AI and technology serve as collaborative tools, enhancing users' capabilities while respecting and preserving human autonomy, values, and the irreplaceable subjective experience of each individual.

Leveraging my background as a UX Designer and my current role as an HCI researcher, I am deeply interested in developing applications that harness AI to boost creativity and streamline the research process.  This approach aims to elevate the quality of knowledge work and accelerate the advancement of human civilization.

**<u>Oportunities</u>**

I am actively seeking research opportunities, including internships and PhD programs. You can check [my CV here](./publicFiles/Sam Ng_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to reach out via email. I am eager to explore potential collaborations and contribute to innovative projects.
