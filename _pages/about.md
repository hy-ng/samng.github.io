**<u>About Me</u>**

I am a second-year M.S. student in Informatics at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Extended Reality (XR)**, **Haptics**, and **Human-Centered AI**.


**<u>My Academic Journey</u>**
- Currenlty I am in the final semester of dual-degree program (Expected: Dec 2024), pursuing an M.S. in Informatics at Penn State. I completed my first master's degree (M.Des. in Interaction Design) at [National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech)](https://www-en.ntut.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"}, [Department of Interaction Design](https://ixd.ntut.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en){:target="_blank"}. 
- Adivsors: I have had the privilege of working with expectional advisors:
  - Current Advisor: [Prof. Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang](http://kennethhuang.cc/){:target="_blank"} at Crowd-AI Lab in Penn State. 
  - Previous Advisor: [Prof. Ping-Hsuan Han](https://pinghsuan.info/){:target="_blank"} at [XR Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@xrlabntut0411){:target="_blank"} in Taipei Tech.

**<u>My Vision</u>**

> I envision a future where AI and technology serve as collaborative tools, enhancing users' capabilities while respecting and preserving human autonomy, values, and the irreplaceable subjective experience of each individual.

Leveraging my background as a UX Designer and my current role as an HCI researcher, I am deeply interested in developing applications that harness AI to boost creativity and streamline the research process.  This approach aims to elevate the quality of knowledge work and accelerate the advancement of human civilization.

**<u>Oportunities</u>**

I am actively seeking research opportunities, including internships and PhD programs. You can check [my CV here](./publicFiles/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}. If you find my profile compelling, please feel free to reach out via email. I am eager to explore potential collaborations and contribute to innovative projects.
